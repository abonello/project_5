### **Notes** 

I already have heroku toolbelt installed on my computer.
```bash
$ heroku
```
gives a list of commands available to use together with a short description.

```bash
$ heroku apps
```
Will give us a list of apps. If you are not logged in you will need to enter login details.

Can also login using:
```bash
$ heroku login
```
Good to switch between accounts too.

9. Install gunicorn
    ```bash
    (venv) $ pip install gunicorn
    ```
    This installs gunicorn 19.9.0  
    This will run the application on the server.

10. Install psycopg2
    ```bash
    (venv) $ pip install psycopg2
    ```
    This installs psycopg2   2.7.7  
    This allows us to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
11. Update requirements.txt
    ```bash
    (venv) $ pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    commit.

12. Create a heroku app
    ```bash
    $ heroku create unique-corn --region eu
    ```
    https://unique-corn.herokuapp.com   
    https://git.heroku.com/unique-corn.git

13. Create a new database on heroku (PostgreSQL)  
    Heroku uses addons to set up databases.
    ```bash
    $ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
    ```
    This creates an empty database.  

    ```
    Database has been created and is available
    ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
    ! data from another database with pg:copy
    Created postgresql-closed-64850 as DATABASE_URL
    Use heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql to view documentation
    ```
14. Install dj_database_url  
    ```bash
    (venv) $ pip install dj_database_url
    ```
    This allows us to parse database urls.
    This installs dj-database-url 0.5.0

15. Update requirements.txt
    ```bash
    (venv) $ pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    and commit.

16. We can view the DATABASE_URL
    ```bash
    $ heroku config
    ```
    This will show us the url of the database which we need for the next step.  
    The same url can be found through the heroku dashboard. Go to settings and open the Config Variables.

17. Create a django project
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject UniQueCorn
    ```


18. Running the django server

    ```bash
    (venv) $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```

    This is giving me an error. A quick goodle search shows:  
    this is a problem between Django and Python 3.7. [Django has a fix](https://github.com/django/django/commit/931c60c5216bd71bc11f489e00e063331cf21f40), but that fix hasnâ€™t made it into a new version yet.

    NB
    line 152 of widgets.py
    ```python
    if params:
        related_url += '?' + '&amp;'.join(
            '%s=%s' % (k, v) for k, v in params.items(),
        )
    ```
    should be replaced by
    ```python
    if params:
        related_url += '?' + '&amp;'.join('%s=%s' % (k, v) for k, v in params.items())
    ```
    Now it works and the server starts properly.
    ---

19. Add 0.0.0.0 to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py

20. Creating a testing app
    ```bash
    django-admin startapp testing
    ```

I am going to create a test app before proceeding to database.

-- Connect to the remote database.  
    Open `settings.py` file and scroll down to the DATABASES section.
