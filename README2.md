## INTRODUCTION
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

This app allows users to log in bugs as well as asks for new features for a fictitious app, **UniQue Corn**, that supposedly produces corn to feed people. This app is mired in bugs and lack of proper functionality, so there will be lots to report. Users can also vote for features and bugs they would like to see fixed. The more votes a feature or bug has, the more likelyhood they have to be worked on.

Artistically, this app is a parody on the current political events in the UK surrounding brexit.

## UXD
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

This app tracks bugs and new features for a fictitious app called UniQue Corn. Data is stored in a **PostgreSQL** database. Users can buy coins which will be spent to request a new feature or vote up features and bugs.


### **Strategy** 
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

**What do I want as the owner of this web app?**
I want users to be able to ask for new features and report bugs they find while using UniQue Corn App. Users can review features and bugs posted by others and leave comments about them. They can also vote for features and bugs to make them happen earlier. Users can vote for a particular feature or bug as many times as they wish if they particularly would like to support a particular one. They can even vote for their own submissions. After all, the more money we can do from this, the better.


#### What does it do?
Track issues, features and bugs reaised by the users for the developers to deal with. The developers get an idea of urgency and backing from users from votes and comments. It is also a source of funding for developing the project.


#### How does it work
Users can read about the UniQueCorn App. If they register, they can request new functionality through the appropriate form. Users can also report bugs as well as comment and vote for features and bugs that are already on the system.

### **Scope** 
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

#### Features to implement

_The app should allow the user to fullfill the following tasks:_

* _Categorize the foods according to food categories._
* _Create, edit and delete categories._ 
* _A category can only be deleted if it is not being used by any food item._
* _Editing a category will change the category name in all food items that are classified under that category._
* _If editing a category name results in a name that is already in use, the food items from the old category will have their category renamed and the total food items using the current (new) category will be updated to reflect the total of the two separate categories. This is needed to keep track of the food items using a category to avoid deleting a category that is being used by food items._
* _Functionality to see all the categories. Here there is also an indication of how many food items make use of each class._
* _Creating a new category will check that the name is not already exist._
* _Food Items can be viewed, added, edited and deleted._
* _Confirmation required for deleting food items or categories._
* _Contact form_


#### User stories
**A user wants to store data about a food item (Category already exists**) 
1. User Clicks on `New Item`
2. Selects a Category (category exists)
3. Fill the rest of the form
4. Clicks `Add Food Item` button

**A user wants to store data about a food item (Category does not exist)** 
1. User Clicks on `New Item`
2. User Clicks on the `Category` field
3. Category does not exist. User clicks on the `here` button, part of the instruction just above the category field.
4. User is taken to the Add Category form.
5. User fills in the form
6. User enters a new category name. (The user can check the categories that already exist.)
7. If the category entered by the user already exist, the user will be alerted to this effect. A message is displayed. The user is prompted to use a different name.
8. If the category does not yet exist, a new category will be created, 0 will be assigned to the value of food items using this category (can be checked by visiting the `Food Categories` page) and the user will be automatically taken back to the `Add Food Item` page.
9. Fill the rest of the form.
10. Clicks `Add Food Item` button.

**User wants to edit a food item**

1. User goes to Food Item list by selecting `Food Items` from the menu.
2. User selects the accordion panel for the food to be edited.
3. User clicks on the `More info and Controls at the Back` button. As a result the card rotates showing the Edit button.
4. User clicks the `Edit` button. The user is taken to the `Edit a Food Item` page.
5. The user makes the changes needed.
6. The user clicks the `Update Food Item` button to accept changes or `Cancel` button to leave the page without changes.

**User wants to delete a food item**
1. User goes to Food Item list by selecting `Food Items` from the menu.
2. User selects the accordion panel for the food to be deleted.
3. User clicks on the `More info and Controls at the Back` button. As a result the card rotates showing the Delete button.
4. User clicks the `Delete` button. The user is taken to the a page to confirm or reject the deletion.
5. The user clicks the `Delete` button to delete or `Cancel` button to leave the page **without** deleting.

**User wants to create a category**
1. User goes to Food Categories list by selecting `Food Category` from the menu.
2. User clicks on the `Add` button at the bottom of the list. This opens a new page.
3. The user types in the name of the category to be added. It is possible for the user to check the existing categories without leaving this page. 
4. The user clicks on the `Add Category` button to add a category
or the `Cancel` button to abort the process and return to the Food Categories list.

5. If the `Add Category` button is selected, the new category name will be checked to see if it is already in use. If it exists an alert is displayed to the user thus prompting the user to change it (or abort).

This same page can be reached from the New Item page. If the user tries to create a category and leaves the name empty, an error message will be displayed.

**User wants to edit a category**
1. User goes to Food Categories list by selecting `Food Category` from the menu.
2. User clicks on the `Edit` link in the same row as the category to be edited.
3. A new page opens which allows the user to make the changes required.
4. User clicks on the `Edit Category` button to accept the changes or the `Cancel` button to abort the process.
5. If the name entered already exist a message is displayed alerting the user to this effect. The user can continue by clicking the `Proceed with Edit` button. In this case the two classes will be merged and the necessary changes to the quantity of food items using the remaining category will be made. Alternatively the user can abort the process by clicking on the `Cancel` button.

If the user tries to edit a category and leaves the name empty, an error message will be displayed.

**User wants to delete a category**
1. User goes to Food Categories list by selecting `Food Category` from the menu.
2. If a category is not being used it will have (0). This number indicates the number of food items using it, in this case, none. The user clicks on the `Delete` link in the same row as the category to be deleted which is enabled(disabled if the category is in use).
3. The user is taken to another page where the user can proceed to delete the category by clicking on the `Delete` button or abort the process by clicking the `Cancel` button.


**User wants to see details of food item (accordion view)**
1. User goes to Food Item list by selecting `Food Items` from the menu.
2. User selects the accordion panel for the food to be edited. Information about this food item will be displayed on a card.
3. If the user wants to see further information, the user can click on the `More info and Controls at the Back` button. As a result the card rotates displaying more information as well as the `Edit` and `Delete` button. Another button, `Back to Front` allows the user to rotate the card back to the front side.

**User wants to compare nutrition values**
1. The user goes to the Dashboard by clicking on the `Dashboard` in the menu.  
    Here the user will see a number of charts powered by d3.js. 
    1. The scatter plots allow the user to click and select  (click & drag) to filter data.
    2. The row chart can be filtered by clicking on items to select. Multiple items can be selected by clicking on more than one item.

    Filtering in this way reduces the amount of food items displayed in the table at the bottom of the page. Filters can also be reset.  

2. Data displayed in the table includes buttons that on clicking, allows the user to see a detailed view of the information about that food item in a modal.


### **Structure**

* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

#### Navigation
There is a navbar at the top of the page which contains the main menu. This menu allows the user to navigate to the main parts of the app.

The Brand Name is linked to the home page.

#### Pages

1. I will have a home page with some description of the project and instructions for using the application.
2. I will have a page to add data [**C**]. This will be reached from a menu item.
3. I will have a page to display [**R**] the items. I will use an accordion structure. I can do one of two things:
    1. There will be a button to lead to a more details. Here there will be a button to delete the item.
    2. All the details will show once an accordion fold is open. There will be a button to delete the item on the accordion item header.
4. In any case the delete [**D**] button will either open a modal or take the user to another page for confirmation.
5. I will have an edit page [**U**]. It will be structured like the add page but will be prepopulated with the data for the particular item to be edited. There will be a button to save the changes or leave without saving changes.
6. There will be a **Dashboard** with DC.js graphs with filters and the possibility to select an item and go to the item's detail page. (Or the accordion fold of that particular item.)

#### Header and Footer
Each page has a **header** below the menu with a title for the current page. The **footer** contains copyright information and links to github and linked-in.

-----------


### Skeleton
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)


There are two ways of viewing the food items.

1. **The accordion view**  
    
    Here, each item is in an accordion panel. Opening a panel will display a card. I chose to display the info on a card which can rotate and show extra information at the back of the card. At the back, the user will also find buttons to edit or delete that particular food item.

    Apart from the button saying: "More info and Controls at the back", the curved arrow at the top right corner of the card is a visual indication pointing to the back of the card.  

2. **Dashboard**  
    In the dashboard view, the user is able to filter items based on categories, and a number of paramter combinations. At the bottom of the page there is a table which initially will show all products, currently up to 1000, but will be reduced depending on the filters applied. The name of the food item in the table is a button.

    Clicking a food item in the table will open a modal which will display the data related to that food item.

    I experimented with styling the modal to make it appear as if it is a piece of paper on a desk. As soon as the user hovers over the modal, the paper-like background changes as if pressure or weight has been applied to it. I tried to achieve an organic effect.

    The user can close the modal in a number of ways.
    * Clicking on the close button.
    * Clicking on the X at the top right corner of the modal.
    * Clicking on the desk (the white border) around the modal.
    * Pressing the esc button on the computer keyboard.

    Gif - first captured as .mov file using quickTime. Then turned into a gif using "Drop to Gif" App.  
    This was further processed to reduce its size online at ezgif.com

## TESTING
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

Unittesting is used. Run `test_run.py`.

The form is validated and it also has a try except to catch if the email address is not accepted by the server. In this case the user is returned to an error page.

If the user clicks on the delete button, a confirmation window will open. The user can confirm or reject the deletion. An item will be reduced from the class used by that item.

If a user selects to edit the food item, a window will open which will be prepopulated with the information of that item. The user can do the changes necessary and then click the "Update Food Item" button.

If the user chooses to reclassify a food item, then the necessary changes to the quantities of the category involved will be applied, (increase to the new category, decrease the old category).

The user can cancel the editing process and will be taken back to the accordion view.

There are three places that will take you to the route which allows for the adding a new category. The app keeps track of the calling place and will return there on cancelling or creating a new category.

It is possible for the user to create a new food item. The form will have the category prepopulated. The user will have to select one. There is the option to create a new category which checks on whether it already exists.

---

I already dealt with NA values in accordion not to show units. Now the same issue appears in the modal. I also realised that if a value had to be missing completely, the units will show on their own both in the accordion and the modal.

For the purpose of testing that these two issues are dealt with, I created two test food items, one having NA in all values that will take a unit and the other has all values empty. At the moment NA will not get a unit in the accordion but will do so in the modal (needs fixing). The food item with empty values will get units in both accordion and modal (both need fixing).

The code for the accordion is in the index.html (will be renamed later on) and that for the modal is in the dashboard3.html (This is the dashboard that I will use but will be renamed.)

I added two new test items, one for when I have a value for Energy 1 but not for energy 2, and the other one for vice versa. I want to hide the **/** in such cases ( as well as when both are missing).
Combinations tested: NA "", value "", NA value, NA NA, "" NA, "" value, "" "", value value, value "", value NA

Accordion Done.
    
#### Bug
When I edit a class the count disappears.  
**Fixed**

#### Bug 
when editing class name to a name that already exist
**Fixed but want to add confirmation step.**

#### bug
When editing a class I need to make sure that the name is not already in use. I checked and at the moment I mess up the data with some classes being assigned to negative number of items and thus unable to deleted them, except from the database itself.
    
#### To do
When I edit the name, check if the name already exist. If yes, ask if the user wants to merge or create a new name. If it is a new name, enter the new name (check) and proceed as usual.  
If the user selects to merge, I need to find the items used by the class being edited and assing them to the new class, adding quantity of the new class and reducing from the edited class. Once the edited class reaches 0, I can delete that class.

Want to add confirmation before merging.
    
Rotation of cards does not work well in all mobile browsers but works in mobile Firefox.

## Deploy to Heroku

* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

Name of app: **food-nutrition**  
URI: [https://food-nutrition.herokuapp.com/](https://food-nutrition.herokuapp.com/)

I am using ***gunicorn*** server. I found that I will have to set less settings myself.  
The differences include:
1. I do NOT need to run ```heroku ps:scale web=1```
2. I do NOT need to manually set the IP and PORT variables in *settings > Reveal Config Vars*.
3. I do NOT need to *Restart all Dynos* from *More*.

In all, using gunicorn makes deploying to Heroku much easier.

The commands needed are: (using this app as example)
1. Install gunicorn
~~~~
pip3 install gunicorn
~~~~

2. Create Procfile
~~~~
echo web: gunicorn run:app > Procfile
~~~~

3. Create/Update requirements.txt
~~~~
sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
~~~~

4. Create the Heroku on the website (allows me to set Region to EU)

5. Log in to heroku (locally, need email and password) and check the apps
~~~~
heroku login
heroku apps
~~~~

6. Initialise git, if not already done and set a remote for heroku
~~~~
git init
heroku git:remote -a food-nutrition
~~~~

7. Push to Heroku
~~~~
git push heroku master
~~~~

DONE. -- Open the app at [https://food-nutrition.herokuapp.com/]()

&nbsp;   
&nbsp;   

---

## Further Notes
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

To access the files on Heroku, 
1. go to **More > Run console**.
2. run the command 
~~~~
heroku run bash
~~~~
3. Use normal bash commands.


## Database
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

Create a MongoDB database on mLab.  
Database name: **food**  
MONGODB VERSION: **3.6.6 (MMAPv1)**

* add user
* add collection: **nutrition100**
* created 3 documents with some data.


I had to do some changes in the code I used in previous projects.  
MONGO_DBNAME and MONGO_URI had to be used as app.config:
~~~~
app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = getDbName()
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = getURI()
~~~~
The port argument complained about the int() method, so now it is:
~~~~
app.run(host=os.getenv('IP'), port=os.getenv('PORT'), debug=True)
~~~~

## Development Notes
* [Back to TOP](#nutrition-value)

### Add Food Item

Implemented **add food item**.

Now updating Heroku.  
The following code:
~~~~
from connection import getDbName, getURI
.
.
.
.
app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = getDbName()
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = getURI()
~~~~

does not work in Heroku.

Instead, in Heroku set environment variables for **MONGO_DBNAME** and **MONGO_URI** with the correct information.

### Classification (Categories)

I created another collection in the database that will hold the different categories of food. This will help to give unity to the data.  

I implemented the code to populate the category input field with categories to select from in the add food item page.

I implemented adding new categories. I also added the functionality of returning to the calling page if the process is cancelled.

Implemented editing a categories.


### Backups

I implemented two routes that are used either to get a backup of the database, or replace the database from a backup file. This will help me in two cases. 
1. I mess up the data during testing where it is quicker to replace the lot rather than edit indivual entries
2. The data has been messed up by someone - I am not currently implementing a log in system.

### Dashboard

Drafted a dsahboard with 2 scatter plots - fats vs sat, carbs vs sugar.

I plan to have 4 scatter plots and a bubble chart:
1. All Fat vs Saturated
2. All Carbohydrates vs Sugar
3. Energy vs Protein (have not decided which Energy value I will use)
4. Sugar vs Salt
5. All Fat vs Carbohydrates with the following additions:
    * size of bubble - Protein
    * color - changes with quantity of Sat fat
    * border color - changes with sugar content.

I want to be able to cancel each individual filter and all filters.
I would like to be able to transfer the filters to the get_food_items view, if it is possible, to display only the selected foods in the accordion.

There is something that need to be changed in the database. Currently, the values are stored in the database with the units attached. This is not what crossfilter etc wants. Numbers should be numbers. I can do the processing in javascript(jQuery) to remove the units before passing the data to crossfilter or I can store the numbers without the units. This is the way I am choosing to do. As a result, the display of data in the accordion view will show without units unless I change the code to add them for display. This is the next step. I also have to remove the code which was adding the units when adding a new food item.


### Resetting filters for Row Chart

I had a problem with resetting the classification row chart stopping working. I tried to see how I can force an svg group name to use with redrawAll(). This led to nowhere. After a long time of trying various things such as trying to use renderlet and on renderlet (both fail), I commented out some of the code that I had and suddenly the reset link worked.  
At this point I started uncommenting one line at a time and managed to narrow the error to 
~~~~javascript
 .xAxis().ticks(4) // DO NOT ADD: This will break the reset filters 
~~~~

Adding this line will stop the resetting of the filters.

By the way the above line of code will also stop
~~~~javascript
.controlsUseVisibility(true)
~~~~
from working. Otherwise it works fine.

Now I turned the reset link to a button to match that for the scatter plots.


### Confirm Delete

Implemented route to delete food item. Tested by creating a test items and deleting them.  
Implemented route to delete food class. Tested by creating a test items and deleting them.

Functionality includes the ability to cancel the delete process.

### Improving classification collection.

I want the classification collection to keep track of the number of food items that use a particular classification.

Also If I come to delete a class, it the confirmation page will tell me how many food items are currently using that class. If there are any food items that use a class, I will not be able to delete that class.

1. Start by taking a current backup of the data.
2. Then, manually add a count key to all documents in the classification collection.
3. Take new backup
4. When I look at the classes route, I see a count of how many Food Items make use of that class.
5. When I create a class, it will start with a default value of count = 0.
6. When I add a food Item, the count is increased by 1.
7. When I delete a food Item, the count is decreased by 1.
8. If I change the class of a food item, its old class will be reduced by 1 and the new class is increased by 1.
9. Deleting a food class is only allowed if that class is not used by any food item.


8. What will happen when I edit a class.
    1. I need to track all the food items that used the new class and have their class edited too.
    2. Having a count of the food items using that class should make sure that all items are edited.


    Breakdown:  
    1. Click edit button
    2. Go to edit page taking id  /edit_class/<class_id>
    3. Type the edit and press Edit Class button
    4. This will take you to the update class page, still carrying id, but now have the form data /update_class/<class_id>
    5. In the update route:
        1. classification = mongo.db.classification
        2. data = request.form.to_dict()
        3. del data["action"]
        4. Get old name of classification
        5. Check that it does not match the new Name (There was a change)
        6. If there was a change [ and count > 0] ie there are food items using this class:
            1. get food table
            2. Find all food items that make use of old class name - make a list of objects
            3. ~~Extra check if needed - decide later:~~
                * ~~Get class count and check that it matches the length of list of all food items using this class~~
            4. For each food item in list of food items:
                * Change the name of the class
        7. classification.update({"_id": ObjectId(class_id)}, data)
        8. return redirect(url_for('get_classification'))
